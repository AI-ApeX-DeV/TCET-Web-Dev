## Data Types

Data or values have data types. Data types describe the characteristics of data. Data types can be divided into two:

1. Primitive data types
2. Non-primitive data types(Object References)

Primitive data types in JavaScript include:

 1. Numbers - Integers, floats
 2. Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
 3. Booleans - true or false value
 4. Null - empty value or no value
 5. Undefined - a declared variable without a value
 6. Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor

Non-primitive data types in JavaScript includes:

1. Objects
2. Arrays

Now, let us see what exactly primitive and non-primitive data types mean.
*Primitive* data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it.

**Example:**

```js
let word = 'JavaScript'
```

If we try to modify the string stored in variable *word*, JavaScript should raise an error. Any data type under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote is a string data type.

```js
word[0] = 'Y'
```

This expression does not change the string stored in the variable *word*. So, we can say that strings are not modifiable or in other words immutable.
Primitive data types are compared by its values. Let us compare different data values. See the example below:

```js
let numOne = 3
let numTwo = 3

console.log(numOne == numTwo)      // true

let js = 'JavaScript'
let py = 'Python'

console.log(js == py)             //false 

let lightOn = true
let lightOff = false

console.log(lightOn == lightOff) // false
```
### Non-Primitive Data Types

*Non-primitive* data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created.
Let us see by creating an array. An array is a list of data values in a square bracket. Arrays can contain the same or different data types. Array values are referenced by their index. In JavaScript array index starts at zero. I.e., the first element of an array is found at index zero, the second element at index one, and the third element at index two, etc.

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums[0] = 10

console.log(nums)  // [10, 2, 3]
```

As you can see, an array, which is a non-primitive data type is mutable. Non-primitive data types cannot be compared by value. Even if two non-primitive data types have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal.

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]

console.log(nums == numbers)  // false

let userOne = {
name:'Asabeneh',
role:'teaching',
country:'Finland'
}

let userTwo = {
name:'Asabeneh',
role:'teaching',
country:'Finland'
}

console.log(userOne == userTwo) // false
```

Rule of thumb, we do not compare non-primitive data types. Do not compare arrays, functions, or objects.
Non-primitive values are referred to as reference types, because they are being compared by reference instead of value. Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object.

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = nums

console.log(nums == numbers)  // true

let userOne = {
name:'Shubham',
role:'developer',
country:'India'
}

let userTwo = userOne

console.log(userOne == userTwo)  // true
```

If you have a hard time understanding the difference between primitive data types and non-primitive data types, you are not the only one. Calm down and just go to the next section and try to come back after some time. Now let us start the data types by number type.

## Numbers

Numbers are integers and decimal values which can do all the arithmetic operations.
Let's see some examples of Numbers.

### Declaring Number Data Types

```js
let age = 35
const gravity = 9.81  // we use const for non-changing values, gravitational constant in  m/s2
let mass = 72         // mass in Kilogram
const PI = 3.14       // pi a geometrical constant

// More Examples
const boilingPoint = 100 // temperature in oC, boiling point of water which is a constant
const bodyTemp = 37      // oC average human body temperature, which is a constant

console.log(age, gravity, mass, PI, boilingPoint, bodyTemp)
``` 

## Strings

Strings are texts, which are under **_single_**  , **_double_**, **_back-tick_** quote. To declare a string, we need a variable name, assignment operator, a value under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote.
Let's see some examples of strings:

```js
let space = ' '           // an empty space string
let firstName = 'Shubham'
let lastName = 'Sah'
let country = 'India'
let city = 'Mumbai'
let language = 'JavaScript'
let job = 'Developer'
let quote = "The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020."
let quotWithBackTick = `The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020.`
```

### String Concatenation

Connecting two or more strings together is called concatenation.
Using the strings declared in the previous String section:

```js
let fullName = firstName + space + lastName; // concatenation, merging two string together.
console.log(fullName);
```

```sh
Shubham Sah
```

We can concatenate strings in different ways.

#### Concatenating Using Addition Operator

Concatenating using the addition operator is an old way. This way of concatenating is tedious and error-prone. It is good to know how to concatenate this way, but I strongly suggest to use the ES6 template strings (explained later on).

```js
// Declaring different variables of different data types
let space = ' '
let firstName = 'Shubham'
let lastName = 'Sah'
let country = 'India'
let city = 'Mumbai'
let language = 'JavaScript'
let job = 'Developer'
let age = 25


let fullName =firstName + space + lastName
let personInfoOne = fullName + '. I am ' + age + '. I live in ' + country; // ES5 string addition

console.log(personInfoOne)
```

```sh
Shubham Sah. I am 25. I live in Mumbai
```

#### Escape Sequences in Strings

In JavaScript and other programming languages \ followed by some characters is an escape sequence. Let's see the most common escape characters:

- \n: new line
- \t: Tab, means 8 spaces
- \\\\: Back slash
- \\': Single quote (')
- \\": Double quote (")
  
```js
console.log('I hope everyone is enjoying Learning JavaScript challenge.\nDo you ?') // line break
console.log('Days\tTopics\tExercises')
console.log('Day 1\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 2\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 3\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 4\t3\t5')
console.log('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') // To write a backslash
console.log('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"')
console.log("In every programming language it starts with \'Hello, World!\'")
console.log('The saying \'Seeing is Believing\' isn\'t correct in 2020')
```

Output in console:

```sh
I hope everyone is enjoying Learning JavaScript challenge.
Do you ?
Days  Topics  Exercises
Day 1 3 5
Day 2 3 5
Day 3 3 5
Day 4 3 5
This is a backslash  symbol (\)
In every programming language it starts with "Hello, World!"
In every programming language it starts with 'Hello, World!'
The saying 'Seeing is Believing' isn't correct in 2020
```

#### Template Literals (Template Strings)

To create a template strings, we use two back-ticks. We can inject data as expressions inside a template string. To inject data, we enclose the expression with a curly bracket({}) preceded by a $ sign. See the syntax below.

```js
//Syntax
`String literal text`
`String literal text ${expression}`
```

**Example: 1**

```js
console.log(`The sum of 2 and 3 is 5`)              // statically writing the data
let a = 2
let b = 3
console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`) // injecting the data dynamically
```

**Example:2**

```js
let firstName = 'Shubham'
let lastName = 'Sah'
let country = 'India'
let city = 'Mumbai'
let language = 'JavaScript'
let job = 'Developer'
let age = 25
let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName

let personInfoTwo = `I am ${fullName}. I am ${age}. I live in ${country}.` //ES6 - String interpolation method
let personInfoThree = `I am ${fullName}. I live in ${city}, ${country}. I am a ${job}. I teach ${language}.`
console.log(personInfoTwo)
console.log(personInfoThree)
```

```sh
I am Shubham Sah. I am 25. I live in India.
I am Shubham Sah. I live in Mumbai, India. I am a Developer. I teach JavaScript.
```

Using a string template or string interpolation method, we can add expressions, which could be a value, or some operations (comparison, arithmetic operations, ternary operation).

```js
let a = 2
let b = 3
console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}: ${a > b}`)
```

```sh
2 is greater than 3: false
```

## Checking Data Types and Casting

### Checking Data Types

To check the data type of a certain variable we use the _typeof_ method.

**Example:**

```js
// Different javascript data types
// Let's declare different data types

let firstName = 'Shubham'      // string
let lastName = 'Sah'        // string
let country = 'India'         // string
let city = 'Mumbai'           // string
let age = 250                // number, it is not my real age, do not worry about it
let job                         // undefined, because a value was not assigned

console.log(typeof 'Shubham')  // string
console.log(typeof firstName)   // string
console.log(typeof 10)          // number
console.log(typeof 3.14)        // number
console.log(typeof true)        // boolean
console.log(typeof false)       // boolean
console.log(typeof NaN)         // number
console.log(typeof job)         // undefined
console.log(typeof undefined)   // undefined
console.log(typeof null)        // object
```

### Changing Data Type (Casting)

- Casting: Converting one data type to another data type. We use _parseInt()_, _parseFloat()_, _Number()_, _+ sign_, _str()_
  When we do arithmetic operations string numbers should be first converted to integer or float if not it returns an error.

#### String to Int

We can convert string number to a number. Any number inside a quote is a string number. An example of a string number: '10', '5', etc.
We can convert string to number using the following methods:

- parseInt()
- Number()
- Plus sign(+)

```js
let num = '10'
let numInt = parseInt(num)
console.log(numInt) // 10
```

```js
let num = '10'
let numInt = Number(num)

console.log(numInt) // 10
```

```js
let num = '10'
let numInt = +num

console.log(numInt) // 10
```

#### String to Float

We can convert string float number to a float number. Any float number inside a quote is a string float number. An example of a string float number: '9.81', '3.14', '1.44', etc.
We can convert string float to number using the following methods:

- parseFloat()
- Number()
- Plus sign(+)

```js
let num = '9.81'
let numFloat = parseFloat(num)

console.log(numFloat) // 9.81
```

```js
let num = '9.81'
let numFloat = Number(num)

console.log(numFloat) // 9.81
```

```js
let num = '9.81'
let numFloat = +num

console.log(numFloat) // 9.81
```

#### Float to Int

We can convert float numbers to integers.
We use the following method to convert float to int:

- parseInt()
  
```js
let num = 9.81
let numInt = parseInt(num)

console.log(numInt) // 9
```
